# Snake Game with Pygame 🐍🎮

Welcome to the Snake Game project created using Pygame libraries! 🚀

## About the Game
This project is a classic Snake Game built with Python and Pygame. It's not just your ordinary Snake Game; it's a fun, user-friendly game that covers all the basic concepts of Python programming.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: We've designed the game interface to be super easy to navigate, making it suitable for players of all ages.

- **Time Challenges**: Thanks to the 'time' library, we've added some time-based challenges to keep you on your toes. Can you grab that apple before the timer runs out? ⏰🍏

- **Randomness Galore**: The 'random' library ensures that the snake's food appears in unpredictable places. You'll need quick reflexes and a keen eye to win! 🎲🐍

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed.
3. Run the `snake_game.py` file.
